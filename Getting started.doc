While I was learning how to work with website cookies, I realised that standard static pages do not store cookies in any way, shape or form. Therefor during this project, I have leared of creating a local host that will host a website until the website gets turned off manualy. While having the website constantly "on", it managed to create a cookie on the website that stored the information needed for me to progress with the projcet.
The code used to create a localhost using node.js is displayed below.
************************************************************
const http = require('http');
const fs = require('fs');
const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  fs.readFile(__dirname + req.url,function(error,data){
    if (error){
      res.writeHead(404,'File not found!');
    }else {
      res.write(data)
    }
    res.end()
  })
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
